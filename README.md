## BertViz

"BertViz is a tool for visualizing attention in the Transformer model, supporting most models from the transformers library (BERT, GPT-2, XLNet, RoBERTa, XLM, CTRL, MarianMT, etc.). It extends the [Tensor2Tensor visualization tool](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensor2tensor/tree/master/tensor2tensor/visualization) by Llion Jones and the [transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) from [HuggingFace](https://github.com/huggingface)."

# ConvNet Playground

## Distill: Exploring Neural Networks with Activation Atlases

Feature inversion to visualize millions of activations from an image classification network leads to an explorable activation atlas of features the network has learned. This can reveal how the network typically represents some concepts.

## Interactive Deep Learning Playground
New to Deep Learning? Tinker with a Neural Network in your browser.

## Initializing neural networks

Initialization can have a significant impact on convergence in training deep neural networks. Simple initialization schemes can accelerate training, but they require care to avoid common pitfalls. In this post, deeplearning.ai folks explain how to initialize neural network parameters effectively.

## Embedding Projector

It's increaingly important to understand how data is being interpreted by machine learning models. To translate the things we understand naturally (e.g. words, sounds, or videos) to a form that the algorithms can process, we often use embeddings, a mathematical vector representation that captures different facets (dimensions) of the data. In this interactive, you can explore multiple different algorithms (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) for exploring these embeddings in your browser.

## OpenAI Microscope

The OpenAI Microscope is a collection of visualizations of every significant layer and neuron of eight important vision models.

# Interpretability, Fairness

## The Language Interpretability Tool

The Language Interpretability Tool (LIT) is an open-source platform for visualization and understanding of NLP models.

You can use LIT to ask and answer questions like:

- What kind of examples does my model perform poorly on?
- Why did my model make this prediction? Can it attribute it to adversarial behavior, or undesirable priors from the training set?
- Does my model behave consistently if I change things like textual style, verb tense, or pronoun gender?

## What if

The What-If Tool lets you visually probe the behavior of trained machine learning models, with minimal coding.

## Measuring diversity

PAIR Explorables around measuring diversity.

"Search, ranking and recommendation systems can help find useful documents in large datasets. However, these datasets reflect the biases of the society in which they were created and the systems risk re-entrenching those biases. For example, if someone who is not a white man searches for ‚ÄúCEO pictures‚Äù and sees a page of white men, they may feel that only white men can be CEOs, further perpetuating lack of representation at companies‚Äô executive levels."

## Interactive Gaussian Process Visualization

"A Gaussian process can be thought of as an extension of the multivariate normal distribution to an infinite number of random variables covering each point on the input domain. The covariance between function values at any two points is given by the evaluation of the kernel of the Gaussian process. For an in-depth explanation, read this excellent [distill.pub article](https://distill.pub/2019/visual-exploration-gaussian-processes/) and then come back to this interactive visualisation!"
