# ConvNet Playground
ConvNet Playground is an interactive visualization tool for exploring Convolutional Neural Networks applied to the task of semantic image search.

## Distill: Exploring Neural Networks with Activation Atlases

Feature inversion to visualize millions of activations from an image classification network leads to an explorable activation atlas of features the network has learned. This can reveal how the network typically represents some concepts.

## Initializing neural networks

Initialization can have a significant impact on convergence in training deep neural networks. Simple initialization schemes can accelerate training, but they require care to avoid common pitfalls. In this post, deeplearning.ai folks explain how to initialize neural network parameters effectively.

## Embedding Projector

It's increaingly important to understand how data is being interpreted by machine learning models. To translate the things we understand naturally (e.g. words, sounds, or videos) to a form that the algorithms can process, we often use embeddings, a mathematical vector representation that captures different facets (dimensions) of the data. In this interactive, you can explore multiple different algorithms (PCA, t-SNE, UMAP) for exploring these embeddings in your browser.

## OpenAI Microscope

The OpenAI Microscope is a collection of visualizations of every significant layer and neuron of eight important vision models.

## Measuring diversity

PAIR Explorables around measuring diversity.

"Search, ranking and recommendation systems can help find useful documents in large datasets. However, these datasets reflect the biases of the society in which they were created and the systems risk re-entrenching those biases. For example, if someone who is not a white man searches for “CEO pictures” and sees a page of white men, they may feel that only white men can be CEOs, further perpetuating lack of representation at companies’ executive levels."

# Interpretability

## The Language Interpretability Tool

The Language Interpretability Tool (LIT) is an open-source platform for visualization and understanding of NLP models.

You can use LIT to ask and answer questions like:

- What kind of examples does my model perform poorly on?
- Why did my model make this prediction? Can it attribute it to adversarial behavior, or undesirable priors from the training set?
- Does my model behave consistently if I change things like textual style, verb tense, or pronoun gender?
